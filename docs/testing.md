# Testing Strategy
    
- Unit Tests: Use Vitest for testing individual functions and utilities
- Component Tests: Combine RTL with createRemixStub for testing components with Remix context
- Integration Tests: Use Vitest for testing loaders and actions
- E2E Tests: Use Playwright for full application flow testing
